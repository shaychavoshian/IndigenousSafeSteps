Hello 👋\
Welcome to the Bridging Tradition and Safety project! 🌍✨ A Community-Based Study on Indigenous Footwear and Fall Prevention!\
We're excited to bridge cultural heritage 🧑‍🎨 and safety innovations 🛡️ to support Indigenous communities.




## Project Description 🌍👟
Our project investigates the role of Indigenous footwear in fall prevention, focusing on the slip resistance of traditional designs compared to Western footwear. Falls are a pressing health issue, especially among older adults, and are even more concerning within Canada’s Indigenous communities, where fall-related hospitalizations are higher.

Through collaborative engagement with Indigenous communities, we aim to gain insights into their footwear preferences, cultural values, and experiences with slips and falls. Our goal is to co-create solutions that blend cultural integrity with modern safety features, ensuring the findings are practical and meaningful for Indigenous populations.

### What Makes This Project Special, Useful, and Exciting 🌟
Bridging Tradition and Innovation: We honor the cultural significance of traditional footwear while improving safety with modern slip-resistant designs.\
Community-Based Collaboration: Indigenous elders, cultural knowledge holders, and fall prevention experts guide the research, making it a truly inclusive project.\
Holistic Approach with Two-Eyed Seeing: By integrating Indigenous and Western knowledge, we bring together two ways of knowing to create well-rounded solutions.\
Direct Impact on Public Health: Our recommendations will enhance safety and reduce fall risks, making everyday activities safer for Indigenous populations.

## Vision 🌠

A world where Indigenous communities thrive safely without compromising cultural traditions. We aim to redefine fall prevention by incorporating Indigenous wisdom into footwear design, making it accessible, safe, and culturally meaningful.
