## Comments

- **Community Engagement**:  
  Building strong relationships with the Indigenous community has been a priority. Trust-building activities have progressed well, and data collection for footwear comparisons is ongoing. Indigenous-designed footwear has been identified as an inspiration for slip-resistant designs.

- **Data Collection**:  
  We tested 10 footwear pairs (Indigenous and Western designs) and are continuing data collection, which will be completed by the end of 2024.

- **Budget**:  
  So far, we have spent $2000 on purchasing Indigenous footwear, $3000 on booking the Winter Lab, and $300 on participant compensation. An additional $1000 will be required for honorariums for focus groups and $1000 for conference registration. Testing with mechanical devices at IRSST in Montreal will require $500 for travel expenses.

- **Knowledge Translation and Social Media**:  
  We prepared a demo to showcase our results to the community, patients, and scientists at UHN. This demo was highly successful and well-received.

- **Courses**:  
  I completed courses in cultural safety and digital health, which have strengthened my approach to inclusive and ethical research practices.

- **Future Focus**:  
  The next phase includes testing traditional Indigenous footwear designs, developing AI-based solutions for slip resistance measurements, and conducting qualitative studies to assess community adoption.

- **Challenges**:  
  Securing additional funds and ensuring community participation for qualitative studies remain key focus areas.

## Next Steps

1. Continue trust-building activities with Indigenous communities.
2. Complete data collection and finalize slip resistance comparisons by December 2024.
3. Begin AI development for slip detection systems (March 2025 target).
4. Plan and recruit participants for qualitative studies (June 2025 target).
